                        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                        <p>After watching the first Blade Runner film, I became obsessed with the genre of sci-fi and the idea of a future full of robots, cyborgs, and flying cars. The film mainly tackles the concept of humanity, and whether or not a bio-engineered humanoid can claim to be truly human. I'm stretching the concept and applying it to an inanimate succulent; can a plant, given a consciousness, become more than just a plant?</p>

                        <h1>Functionality</h1>
                        <p>The main functions would be the ability to move, sense light, sense moisture, and play audio. For movement, I used two DC motors driven by PWM using a motor driver. For light sensing, I used 4 photocells, one in each direction. The moisture sensor doubled as a switch, indicating when the plant pot is inserted (I'll get into that later).</p>
                        <h1>Mapping I/O</h1>
                        <p>I had to integrate the photocell readings with the outputs of the motors. The robot would turn until the highest reading is in the front sensor, and move forward until the average of all photocell readings meet a predetermined value. If the difference between all photocell readings are neglible, then the robot simply stops turning and gives up.</p>
                        <p>The speaker would play audio when the moisture levels dip below a certain threshhold, announce that it's quenched, or declare it's own death with a recording of the <i>Tears in The Rain</i> monologue from Blade Runner</p>

                        <p>I decided to have the base and the plant be separate. This way, the plant pot could be switched out, and I envision being able to detect the plant type with RFID tags and attributing a unique for each breed of plant. Additionally, by placing leads that ran up from the outside of the pot into the dirt, the pot would create contact with the moisture sensor only when inserted. I effectively created a switch that detected both moisture levels and when the pot is inserted and removed, as the reading would immediately drop to zero when removed.</p>

                        <p>This was the first time I've built a working electronic product, so there were definitely a lot of changes in my process that I had to adopt. I've learned that designing parts to house components requires precise measurements and knowledge of tolerances for the 3D printer. Electronics require careful reading and research of documentation, and extensive planning for the circuitry. Everything on the inside was either dangling or taped together, so a next step would be to build something more rugged and reliable.</p>

I fitted all of the wires and the breadboard within the paper cup, cut two wholes for the IR emitter and receiver, and then tucked it all within a sock. I cut a circular opening in the sock and glued on a circular segment cut from a paper cup. This allowed the ping pong ball head to be snugly attached to the sock.</p>

As a demonstration, I set up the robots to send each other random musical notes to play. If I had more time, I would've liked to make it more evident that information was actually being sent via IR, and apply some sort of music theory, so that the notes being sent were not just random.</p>

                        <h1>Description</h1>
                        <p>Initially inspired to create something explicity be used as a productivity tracker, I decided to instead make a product driven by its user interaction and experience, leaving the functionality up to the user. The moodboard is an open ended device, framed to be used as a calendar and journal. Users encode information through the act of placing colored wooden balls within the slots. Recognizing the lack of tactile response in the age of digital devices, it invites users to interact through touch. There needs to be just enough instruction so that users would know what to do and what could be done, but not have creativity be limited.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Research / Inspiration</h1>
                        <p>There's something about balls that bring out the playful curiousity in people; they beg to be picked up, felt, rolled. Most children experience some form of ball as their first toy. I wanted to channel the universality of the ball and communicate functionality without the need of words or images. </p>
                        <p>I've always loved Rube Goldberg machines and marble runs. The first time I encountered one of these was in the Stanford Pediatric Hospital. Forgetting whatever ailment I was burdened by, I was transported into another world, built upon the zigging and zagging of colored balls speeding on metal rails. The excitement I felt as they turned a tight corner, sat patiently as a hammer wound up behind it, and came to an exhausting stop just to be sent back to the start, lifted by a tiny elevator.</p>

                        <p>Hoping to emulate the captivation that I felt watching the kinetic sculptures, I wanted to create a spectacle every time the user operated the device. I initially wanted to create an intricate network of winding paths behind a grid of boxes, which balls would roll down to reach the next unfilled slot. The design became overly complicated, and I had to decide where to best concentrate my efforts in order to make the most intuitive, immersive, and rewarding device.</p>

                        <h1>Choosing Tactility over Spectacle</h1>
                        <p>This meant that I wouldn't have to deal with figuring out how to get the balls to their intended slots, and how to then reset the board. Users would be able to place the balls themselves, and run their hands along the board to then remove them. With this approach, I could capitalize on the tactility of the balls and the wooden material, and allow intuitive, physical feedback when operating the device.</p>

                        <p>Xondas is a company on the UofM campus founded by a group of professors within the EE and Physics department. They wanted to utilize magnetic levitation in the product to highlight the fact that they could transfer a large amount of power across an empty space. Being the first time I've worked on a project with a group of engineers for the goal of commercialization, I was extremely humbled and nervous. My work had to be much more meticulous than the scrappy prototypes that I made for class. </p>

                        <p>After much debate and discussion, we came to the conclusion that, with their goal being to start a crowdfunding campaign, we'd want a slick product that would capture the target market of young tech-loving adults. I pitched many ideas that would utilize wireless power, including a living boardgame, floating lavalamp, and electronic building blocks. For the sake of simplicity, though, we decided to stick with a floating lamp. Although the idea itself wasn't entirely new, Xondas' technology allowed 10 watts to light an entire room, whereas in competitors only a dim LED could be powered. Specs like this, though, are hard to sell, and ultimately the product would have to stand out with its look and feel.</p>

                        <p>After experimenting with a levitating magnet kit, I determined the ideal volume, shape, and mass that something would need to keep afloat. It can't be too large, or it'll wobble and topple over. It can't be too heavy, or it won't levitate very high. It's also got to be symmetrical. We found that by tweaking some settings, we could have the base float on an angle, exaggerating the effect of suspension. </p>

                        <p>Throughout the whole design process, I worked in parallel with the engineering team to determine dimensions for custom PCB's for my forms.

                        <p>With the access to amazing rendering software, I've largely neglected to hone craftsmanship when it comes to building presentable prototypes. With this project, I tried my best to pay attention to developing practically informative, yet beautiful prototypes. In this version I used XTC-3D, and epoxy coating, to smooth the print. I then sanded the surface and applied a combination of primer and matter spray-paint to create an ideal representation of the material.</p>

                        <p>This year-long project gave me opportunities to experiment and learn that I couldn't have otherwise received from the classroom. It was the first step to learning how to develop feasible, realiable parts, through rigourous testing and collaboration. As a result, I've become more intentional with my design decisions, and learned the value of rapid prototyping as I became more knowledgable in 3D printing and materials. Most importantly, I learned how to collaborate with other disciplines, allowing my own expertise be enhanced by the knowledge of others, and to better utilize my voice and visual tools to communicate, negotiate, and realize a product. </p>

                        <h1>Findings</h1>
                        <p>We found that most pre-adolescents are beginning to have their own digital devices. Phone use before sleep is a shown to be a key cause for poor sleep quality, and parents find it extremely difficult consistently regulating phone usage especially at bed time. We thought that this would be a perfect point of intervention.</p>

                        <p>After a whole round of concept testing, research, and a design review, we settled on our phone box concept. It would be a box that helps children develop good sleep habits by restricting media use before bedtime. A timer could be set on the parent’s phone, and the child’s phone will be locked until they wake up. We were striving to create a means for parents to passively regulate their children's phone usage, so instead of having to force kids to give up their devices, they would learn to put their devices away under their own power.</p>

                        <p>The central feature that I wanted to design around was the storage and retrieval of the phone. It must be intuitive, provide instant feedback, and also be rewarding to use. A few ideas we looked at were casette tape players, and how the tapes would be slotted in, and the lid would give a really nice click when closed. The lid would then sit flush. I really liked this aspect, because when closed, the device would be out of sight, and out of mind. The box would appear to be unopenable, until the timer goes off and the lid magically pops open. </p> 
                        <h1>Mechanism</h1>
                        <p>I decided that this casette mechanism would not work with different sized phones. I ideated around different spring and lock mechanisms. I settled on having the spring and lock both on the front side of the lid. This way, the lid would pop open when the time is up, and the phone could be take straight out.</p>

                        <p>For our design review, I wanted to just focus on building a prototype that would lock when closed, and pop open after delay when a button is pressed. The challenge was to create a compact mechanism that would detect the lid, lock it, and also automatically open. This was the design that I settled on: on the lid, there is a potrustion for a servo to latch on, when the lid is pressed down, it compresses a spring, and at the base of the spring is a pushbutton that would then be actuated. This tells the arduino when the lid is closed, and the servo would then turn to latch the lid closed. When the timer is up, the servo unlatches, and the spring decompresses to pop the lid back up.</p>

                        <p>After concept testing and a design review, we decided that to make this a more viable and attractive product, we'd need a few extra features. We decided to have a digital clockface so kids would be able to see the time without needing to take their phones out. This meant that I had to add a slanted face, so this changed the overall design quite a bit. A UV sanitizing light and wireless charging would make the product essentially a smart device hub. Additionally, we added an adjustable nightlight. </p>

                        <p>I wanted to make sure the product was both fun to look at and to use. I used a light-up arcade button as the central point of interaction. Both the lid and the nightlight would be controlled by the button, so there was some trickiness to figuring out the code in arduino. Additionally, I was grappling with the limited space, and had to modify various components by sawing down the plastic and stripping down parts. We wanted to showcase the customizeability of our device, so I made two different colored versions, and lined the insides with different fabrics.</p>

                        <p>A prevelant theme in my work has been reflection and productivity. A lot of it has been geared towards better understanding myself, my habits, and how to optimize my productivity. The challenge is in achieving these goals through quantitative data that can be easily obtained from the user. Is there anything different that I could do than our smart devices? My solution was to build a device around the core idea of being able to intuitively store and display data, and in turn capture patterns in the user's behavior. </p>

                        <p>The more documentation I read, I the more confused I got. I had ambitious plans for my project, thinking that it'd be a breeze transitioning from arduino, but the raspberry pi was a while different beast. I gave myself one task: figure out the LED matrix that would be the centerpiece of the user interface.</p>
                        <h1>Giving up on the LED Matrix</h1>
                        <p>I designed a friendly smiley face to display on the matrix. The hope was that I could create a state machine that would display animated gifs as feedback. Initializing the rpi matrix was difficult enough; after frying an SD card and spending days debugging glitchy output, I realized that I also had a faulty microcontroller. I switched to a new rpi and everything worked. Except that the test script wasn't able to display GIFs, and eventually discovering that every script on github was outdated, I kind of just decided to temporarily give up on the display.</p>
